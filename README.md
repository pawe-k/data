Portfolio of data projects highlighting analytics, visualization, and modeling skills. Continuously updated with new work as I expand my expertise.
Final_Mort_Prob_MLM â€“ Code for a study analyzing real-world mortality datasets from Mississippi Farm Bureau Insurance, applying statistical modeling and predictive techniques to assess risk across demographic groups (age, gender, socioeconomic status). This project integrates actuarial concepts with applied analytics, leveraging professional collaboration with the actuarial department to contextualize findings in the insurance industry. The analysis explores patterns in mortality risk, evaluates demographic drivers of variability, and applies predictive modeling frameworks to estimate outcomes for different policyholder groups. Results were presented to the Mathematics Department at Mississippi College, highlighting both the methodology and real-world applications of actuarial data in insurance risk management. This project provided practical exposure to actuarial science and advanced statistical methods, bridging the gap between academic modeling and industry practice.
